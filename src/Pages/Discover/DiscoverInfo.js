    // this is section 3, the UI section.
    // the general philosophy here is to do as much with HTML and CSS as possible.
    // there is arguably more memorization in HTML and CSS,
    // but HTML and CSS are pretty much incapable of crashing things.
    // it also helps the pages read top to bottom, which saves maintainers from hunting down what certain abstractions actually do.
    // there are some exceptions. if there is code that is repeated an absurd amount of times, abstract it to remove absurd clutter.
    // but shoot for less rather than more abstraction.
    //
    // to each their own, but I would generally prefer something like
    // arr.map(e => (
    //    <p className="pageSection_element">
    //          <a>{e.text} more html...</a>
    //          more html...
    //    </p>
    // </p>));
    //
    // instead of
    // arr.map(e => <SomeComponentIMade prop={e.someAttribute} />)
    //
    // the first example pretty much shows what anyone familiar with boring, basic HTML would be expecting to see on the page.
    // the second example would require a (likely small but at least considerable) degree of scavenging.
    // things that get used on tons of different pages are good candidates for getting abstracted into components.
    //
    // Of course, all these comments are my personal preference.
    // Do at your discression. if things get really messy, abstract.
    // If you have something you truly believe to be a superior alternative, please pursue that.
    // But yeah, my general approach again was: do as much with HTML and CSS as possible, as those are braindead and more fool-proof.
    // Using react and javascript minimally, in my opinion, seems to reduce bugs.
    // The website still has its fair share of bugs.
    // But if I did not try to keep things braindead for myself, I'm sure I'd end up with the Crash-Master-2000.
    // I'm not trying to self-deprecate either; just generally goes hand-in-hand with my honesty.
    //
    // A lot of my other files outsource code into pretty shoddy abstractions.
    // Don't look to those as any sort of example.
    // I was being silly.
    // Abstractions (generally) use Javascript.
    // Braindead HTML pretty much does not.+
